/*
üß† What is Serializable Middleware?
Serializable Middleware (specifically serializableCheck) is part of the default middleware that Redux Toolkit provides.

Its job is to:

Warn you if you put non-serializable values in your Redux actions or state.

Why? Because Redux expects:

Actions = plain JS objects (serializable)

State = serializable JSON-like data

‚ö†Ô∏è Why is this important?
If your action or state includes things like:

Date objects

class instances

Map, Set

window, localStorage, etc.

You might:

Break time-travel debugging

Break Redux dev tools

Corrupt state on rehydration (e.g., with redux-persist)

So serializableCheck helps you catch these bugs early.
